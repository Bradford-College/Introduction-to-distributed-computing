# How to run

1. Open two terminal windows.

2. In the first terminal, run Peer 1:
```bash
python peer_1.py
```

3. In the second terminal, run Peer 2:
```bash
python peer_2.py
```

### Note
Each peer can run in its own terminal, allowing you to simulate multiple peers communicating with one another.
You can extend this architecture by adding more peers and modifying the code to handle multiple connections.
